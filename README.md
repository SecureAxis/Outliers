# Outliers

Welcome to the **Outliers** section of the **SecureAxis Arsenal**!

In the vast world of offensive security, not everything neatly fits into predefined categories. The **Outliers** directory is where we store tools, scripts, and projects that are unique, innovative, and don't necessarily align with the other predefined categories in our arsenal. While they might be outliers in terms of categorization, their value and utility in a red team operation or bug bounty scenario are undeniable.

## Contents

- **Innovative Scripts**: Those scripts which offer something different from the norm.
- **Unique Tools**: Tools developed for very specific scenarios or challenges.
- **Experimental Projects**: Our playground for new ideas. This might contain beta versions or PoCs.

## FAQ

**Q: Why have an Outliers category?**
A: Because innovation doesn't always fit into a box. Some of our best tools defy traditional categorization.

**Q: Can I suggest tools or scripts to be added here?**
A: Absolutely! We're always open to community contributions. If it's unique and doesn't fit elsewhere, this might be its home.

**Q: Is everything here tested?**
A: While we strive to test everything, the nature of this directory means some tools might be in beta or experimental stages. Always use with caution.
